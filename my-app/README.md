#MyFirstEverPersonalWebsite

---Introduction:

Hi there! I am Zara, a student of programming and here is my first attempt to create a personal website. The website contains some information about me, my skills and my background. The project is a part of a course I am taking in frontend programming. It is a website created with HTML/CSS using the React framework. I really enjoyed creating the website, playing with graphics, design, colours and shapes. I hope you will enjoy scrolling through it as well, and if you have any suggestions or comments, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me through the links available on the webpage.

---Prerequisites:

To access the website, you would only need internet connection. Here is the link to 'GitHub URL Placeholder'. If you want to have access to Backend features, you would need to download the repository and run the application through Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. You would also need to install node packages to start the React application with: node install command in the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

---How to Install:

Clone the project from GitHub to your desired folder.

Open the project with Visual Studio Code, open the terminal and type node install

After the completion, type npm start in the terminal, and hit enter.

The website soon will open.

---How to navigate:

At the top left corner of the website, you will see a dropdown menu, which will redirect you through different sections of the website to ease the navigation of the content.

There it is, not much more to say. Hope you will enjoy it and let me know any thoughts you might have!
